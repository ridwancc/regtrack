This is a Svelte project that utilises the MediaStream API, Web Worker API, and OpenCV, to detect and track vehicle number plates in a video stream.

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Run
```bash
npm run start
```

## Usage
If you're device has more than one camera available, you can select which one to use in the dropdown menu. Wide angle cameras are not recommended as they can produce blurry images. If you're device has no cameras available, you can select the demo mode to use a video file instead.
